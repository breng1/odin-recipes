            This recipe is from <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">Just One Cookbook</a>.

        </p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lb cooked Japanese short-grain rice (this is the total amount of rice made from 2 rice cooker cups (360 ml) of uncooked short-grain rice)</li>
            <li>3.5 oz pickled plums (ko ume)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
            <li>3 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) (Cut the nori sheets in thirds)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard the seeds from pickled plums.</li>
            <li>Mince the plums with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped pickled plums and sesame seeds to the steamed rice.</li>
            <li>With a rice paddle, mix well together using a cutting motion. Donâ€™t make it mushy. Roughly divide the rice into 6 or 8 equal portions.</li>
            <li>Prepare a bowl of water and a bowl of kosher salt. Wet both hands and then dip 2 fingertips in the salt and spread between your palms.</li>
            <li>Scoop the rice onto your palm. Gently press and form the rice into a triangle. I use three fingers (thumb, index finger, middle finger) to make a triangle corner.</li>
            <li>When you press, your hands should be just firm enough so the rice ball doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.</li>
            <li>Wrap the rice ball with nori seaweed. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
