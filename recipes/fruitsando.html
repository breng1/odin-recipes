            <li>300 ml heavy cream (double cream) chilled</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp granulated / caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sweetened condensed milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fruit of your choice (I used below)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 banana</li>
            <li>1 kiwi fruit</li>
            <li>1 orange</li>
            <li>12 small strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the fruit. Banana and kiwi: peel and cut into bite size pieces. Strawberries: remove the calyx. Orange: peel the outside and inside skin. Pat the fruit with a paper towel to remove excess water.</li>
            <li>Place the sugar and the heavy cream (double cream) in a large bowl and beat with an electric beater until soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk and beat until firm peaks.</li>
            <li>Spread the cream evenly on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Arrange the fruit over the cream on one side of 4 sliced bread with an awareness of how to look the cut section of the fruit.</li>
            <li>Put some more whipped cream on the fruit, filling the gap between the fruit.</li>
            <li>Cover the fillings with the other slice of bread. Then wrap each sandwich with plastic wrap. Remember or mark on the wrap which direction you want to cut the sandwich in half to show the beautiful cut section of the fruit.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. Then Remove the plastic wrap and gently cut in half each sandwich with a sharp knife. Cut the crusts off if you want.</li>
        </ol>
